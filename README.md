# Crisis Calls
Family and Children's Service 2020 Crisis Call Analysis. This was a group project for the whole class using real world data.

## About Family and Children's Service
Family & Children’s Service (FCS) serves all people in crisis and transition by meeting them where they are, understanding their needs, and connecting them to the resources they need. FCS often ‘fills in the gaps’ in social services, creating a safety net to ensure that all children and families can be safe and healthy. Each year we provide services to more than 50,000 Tennesseans.
Our mission is to connect individuals and families to hope, to healing, and to one another.

The Crisis Line provides free telephone counseling and support to anyone experiencing a crisis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
Crisis counselors assist callers struggling with thoughts of suicide, grief, depression, anxiety, domestic violence, divorce, parenting problems, addiction or serious mental illness. 
Language translation services are available.

## General Info
This was a group project for the whole class. We were given the Crisis Line call data from 2019 and 2020. We split into teams, did initial exploration of the data, and assigned different tasks to each team based on the client needs.
My role in this project was Team Lead for my team which analyzed call volumes by the following criteria:
- Season
- Holidays / Current events
- Times of day
- Days of week
- Comparison of 2020 vs 2019
- Examining 'imminent risk' call volume

My role as Team Lead was as follows:
- Meet with other Team Leads to divide up work efficiently 
- Share my team's work with other teams
- Communicate project needs to my team
- Assign tasks and meet deadlines
- Analyze data and produce graphs in Python
- Collaborate with other teams whose work crossed over with ours

In the presentation I presented slides 10-19, with slide 13 being a chart that I made. 

## Takeaways
This project was a fantastic learning experience. As a class we were able to deliver effective insights to FCS that will help them with staffing and fundraising. 
It was also very collaborative as our class did a fantastic job communicating and working together. We made the presentation on Google Slides which allowed multiple people to edit the presentation at once.
